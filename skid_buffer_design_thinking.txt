Points to be noted:

-- skid buffer is the smallest Pipeline_FIFO_buffer, with only two entries. 
-- Useful for concurrency/timing closure, not for smoothing out data rate mismatches.
-- bcz of being smaller than LUTRAM/Block-RAM, give more freedom for Place N route.

-- Aim is to allow each end to send off one item of data without having to wait for a response  

-- e_valid_o closely follows e_valid_i w/o a clock delay. 
-- assign valid_o = valid_i;
-- skid buffer acts as pass through when both valid_i and ready_i are high.
-- signal used to indicate if there is data to send -> "Valid"
-- signal used to indicate if the module is able to receive data -> "ready"
-- when valid and ready are both high, data transfer occurs.

-- what are "credit based connections"?
